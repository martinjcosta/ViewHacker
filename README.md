# ViewHacker
As the world of Android development continues to grow, there is a constant need for new and innovative libraries to help developers access and manipulate views. Introducing our newest addition to the Android library scene: ViewHacker. With ViewHacker, accessing and modifying views has never been easier or more confusing!

One of the unique features of ViewHacker is its use of slow, Java-based annotations. These annotations not only slow down your development process, but also make your code almost impossible to read and understand. But don't worry, we've also included an obfuscation feature that will rename all of your views to random, meaningless names, just to make things even more fun!

Unfortunately, we have not yet added support for Jetpack Compose. But fear not! ViewHacker is still compatible with your Compose code. In fact, it automatically generates Rust files from your existing Compose code. This Rust code is then translated into React Native code, giving you the best of both worlds: slow, confusing Java annotations and a completely different technology stack.

We know that you're always looking for the latest and greatest in Android development tools, and we're confident that ViewHacker will meet all of your needs (even if you didn't know you had them). With its slow annotations, obfuscated view names, and Rust-to-React-Native magic, you'll be hacking your way to success in no time!
